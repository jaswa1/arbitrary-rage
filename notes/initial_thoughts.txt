New TCGPlayer seller - $29k in sales in 31 days
Discussion
I posted on this mid the flurry and got several dozen DMs, now that I'm through I'm posting more details if others find it helpful.

I started casually selling on tcgplayer at the beginning of June to establish an account so I could sell my collection singles easily. I hit seller level 4 on 27 June.

Around this time I ran some numbers and noticed a set of sealed products that averaged 260% value when sold as singles. I also noticed < 10 sellers were cracking and selling this, and it was not listed on mtgstocks or mox alpha. I sold the ones I had as a test run and as it worked, I rapidly ramped up the volume.

I tracked seller volume, singles value and sealed value daily to get an idea of when to stop buying sealed, and figured I had about 4-5 weeks before the arbitrage was gone.

My predictions were fairly accurate, and by the end of July margin was < 40% before fees so I stopped aggressively pricing and selling.

Did this for fun and to learn the seller market.

4 week stats - 30 June to 30 July
Net sales: $29,604.34

Orders: 1827

Sealed products cracked: 70

Net per order: $25.50

Net after fees: $25,808.99

Sealed cost basis: $14,100

Postage, supplies: $2,500

Profit: $9,208

Fulfillment Process
Had a ton of fun doing trial and error on the packing and shipping process. By the end my speed maxed out at 30 orders in 60 minutes. This wasn't stable but > 20/hour was pretty consistent.

HP Laserjet B&W printer for packing slips

Thermal 4x6 label printer

6 envelope for <= $50 orders

4x8 bubble mailer for >= $50 orders

Pirateship for bubble mailer orders + tracking

Either stamps.com or tcgtracking.com + stamps.com for #6 envelope orders

Pulling
Because I was selling one set of sealed products with < 500 unique cards, I was able to use 2-4 card sorting trays, 1-4 slots per letter of the alphabet for rapid pulling. This made pulling a lot faster.

Packing
Top loaders

Shipping shields

Penny sleeves

Team bags

Larger team bags

Masking tape + dispenser

Packing tape + dispenser

All packing slips folded 3x into a 4.25 x 2.75 dimension.

Single cards penny sleeved and then top loaded, and slotted into the packing slip fold face down so the card can't escape. Masking tape seal around the packing slip and top loader to fix together. Expensive single cards also get a team bag over the top loader Multiple cards get either a shipping shield or go into team bag with top loader backing Large orders go in larger slab team bags. All variations wrapped around folded packing slip and taped to secure. Expensive orders get a slab team bag around the whole thing.

All envelopes taped over on the backside with packing tape.

After everything is packed, I review the PWEs for fat ones and added on non-machinable postage or extra ounce postage as needed.

Errors / Learnings
Because I fold the packing slip to have 3 paper layers on either end, I experimented with slotting < $2.00 order single cards in the middle of the packing slip, slotted so there's only an opening on one side, and taping that over with masking tape. While I got no reports of damage, two people badly reviewed there was no top loader so I stopped doing this right after the feedback.

I had an original bias for shipping shields, but moved over more to toploaders as I found more non-machinable postage issues with the shields.

Fallout
100% positive feedback by the end

4 negative reviews in total managed to get them all removed with refunds / replacements / working with tcgplayer

~15 missing packages, ~5 showed up later on, the rest refunded.

~20 envelopes returned due to postage issues, some valid, some not

3 mis-filled orders, corrected

~5 people provided bad addresses, I paid postage again for reshipment

3 people reporting quality issues.

Feel free to ask any other questions or things I can provide more detail on.

I get OP won’t want to share the set since it likely still has that 200% gain.

But as a reader I am very skeptical there is some set out there with guaranteed returns people just haven’t realized yet.

We know the sealed investment was $14,100 and they cracked 70 sealed products.

That's an average of ~$201 per sealed product.

The gain is now gone, but I don't want to ruin future value for similar opportunities, hence not sharing. People eventually caught on to this and hence arbitrage fell quick, as expected. But I found it before most and took advantage of it.

Tbf, the lazy were never going to get into it. Its good profit. But it required at 14K in upfront cost in sealed product as well as all the materials for packaging and time to fulfill 1800 orders in 30 days...

Doing some quick math, thats fulfilling about 80+ orders everyday over 22 days (assuming OP did this basically fulltime and took a few days off to not go insane, or 60ish orders a day literally everyday with no day off)

Bonus points to OP since FF (the set he presumably did this with) was the most profitable set to date

First, it's pretty obvious OP cracked FIC Collector's Edition. 70 precons at about $200 each ($800 each set), and less than 500 unique cards including tokens.

Second, OP this was a unique timing/event because TCGplayer Direct was down last couple months and therefore have not had to compete with Direct sales. As more Direct inventory comes back online, expect Marketplace sales to slow. Your profit margins may stay about the same or slightly lower as adjusts to Direct sales competition, but volume should drop considerably since FIN and FIC are again available on Direct.

I thought so with TCG Direct but when they came back on my sales volume surprisingly didn't suffer much. I wrote automated scripts for aggressive and frequent repricing, which helped.

Only a handful of sets are back but not enough for the Cart Optimizer to consistently choose Direct as the lowest priced option.

That's pretty cool, keep that edge, because most TCGplayer sellers are surprisingly not tech savvy.

Just last bit, keep in mind the $9,000 net profit represents your labor cost. If total time including buying, cracking, sorting, organizing, pulling, and pricing, is about 2 minutes per order for 1,800 orders, you effectively earned $150 per hour. I'd be surprised if wasn't closer to 4-5 minutes total time per order. So be sure to value your time accordingly if you start moving outside of a single set of precons (which are easy to sort and organize).

You're definitely the sharpest person in the comments. Correct on all that.

This was a one-time thing for fun - I make great $ with my regular business. On the side, I'm building an analytics platform to catch more opportunities like this and if that yields frequent results I'll hire out the time. Mostly did this to learn the market with hands on.

During the peak I did hire someone for $15/hour to help me, and with that it was still easy margins.

Yeah, I do the same - big data/geospatial/analytics/AI etc. It's very easy to track trends and make trades before TCGP/Cardmarket/CardTrader/BinderPOS catch-up. Generally they're on 6/12 or 24 hr price-check cycles.

If you run/scan through the BinderPOS websites along with TCGP etc., you can functionally HFT cards for easy arbitrage.

Recently it's big flags were rereleases of LotR bundles at MSRP, and MKM as surveil lands were spiking but the set was available for like $70/box.

In other words "Most of you nerds won't be able to do this because I'm leveraging tech and knowledge that takes years to learn and purchase"

And "My startup costs would have been much higher if not for the tech I already had".

I'm sure there is some nuance here, but the fact that you own an automation tech would have been a very beneficial disclosure in your OP.

Also curious your approach to scripting and automation without api access. I have been unsuccessful botting tcgplayer site for data crawl either.

Closest I have gotten is a local python program that I manually upload up to date data dumps from Tcg and then it outputs an easily consumable repricing csv, I’m guessing this is the approach you took? Would love to hear if you handled a different way though!

TCG Player is surprisingly lenient on bot access.

I collect serials as a hobby, and have had an automation running that reads all listings of every serialized card on the market (~750 listings) every 5 minutes and slacks it to me. This has been running for 4 months without a single 429.

What are you using to bot? I was very unsuccessful but I’m also a shitty non-coder so I suspect it was more on my part than the site.

Would love to further automate my program

I also did quite well with Final Fantasy collector commander decks. Those surge foils were selling LIKE MAD the first few weeks and for so much.

The Cloud deck was especially juicy. That Secret Rendezvous going for like 50-60+ was sweet. So many good equipment. Sol Ring and Arcane Signet selling for more because people like FFVII a lot (Cloud on Arcane signet).

But yea, they're trailing off. Hard to move the super cheapies now (the common and cheap lands and stuff).

Nice work.

Sales proof: https://imgur.com/a/GjsOnoy

Clearly I have intentionally not said what the product is. I apologize but the people actually making money on MTG finance are the ones who don't throw their money in the air in town square. I'm trying to give as much helpful data about my experience as I can.

You're not going to find the location to the treasure chest on the school bulletin board.

With a tiny bit of study you'll find what I was selling, and congrats. You put in the effort and deserve to take future advantage of it.

I don’t know what you’re paying for pwe tracking but Letter-track will allow you to track regular mail for about 18 cents per envelope you provide your own stamp. They give you 5 for free when signing up. The only downside I found is that you can’t upload the tracking number to tcgp

@op

I had some similar situations that got me started in June.

I'll say that I got stared because I bought boxes of FIN at retail and opened a bunch and pulled a couple good cards. I decided to try and sell to make my money back and then it blew up.

I've been working my ass off since. Did 270 orders from this weekend with EoE.

I ain't doing the numbers fully, because honestly it is challenging for me to fully realize and capture the full costs since I started.

We put everything into expanding our infrastructure immediately. I am "up" but not by your margins.

I have captured my expenses for tax purposes, as I have ~25k in sales, but that sure as shit ain't profit.

The people in this community don't seem to be the kind to lift you up. All I have seen since being here is a constant pessimistic, manipulative maybe attitude on trying to get people OUT of the market.

"This x is going to flop because I have opinion x"

Just enjoy your development, you don't owe anything to anyone on here. They are too disgruntled at their own failures to give any positive energy to you.

My growing pains i have shared is moving from $25 and up in bubble mailers to $50 and up in mailers.

I have been having quite a few $10-20 orders "not arriving" lately too. Starting to get a Lil suspicious, but not too wild to think USPS is just ass.

My whole deal was to do this on the side and see if I can turn profit. (Not flipping sealed) I still don't like that. I don't need anyone here to tell me i am or am not being successful.

Be proud, you have pushed out a ton of orders. Keep it up.

Thank you to OP for your post! I've been selling since end of last year but was never really trying to make money so much as sell cards that I didn't need. It started growing this summer because of FIN but I still wasn't actively trying. I decided recently that I want to grow it more and maybe have my own LGS one day and then a buddy of mine saw your post today and sent it my way. Very helpful and really have me thinking about how I want to grow and work on my approach. Appreciate the recommendation of tcgtracking.com. I have been sending everything just straight stamps (I like to use the dnd stamps) and haven't had issues but I have had a few large orders that need tracking and it becomes more complicated and the profit margin drops. Looking forward to using this on my next big order.

I believe it, back when CLB Draft Boxes were on fire sale that no one wanted, I would scoop cases on cases of them for average $60 a box, and I'd be selling the singles for an average $100, alot of it due to decent uncommon values helping to pad value. Sometimes just gotta keep a keen eye out for opportunities and value asymmetry.

I’d look into eBay a bit more, with eBay Standard Envelope it speeds up my process quite a bit than what I was doing with TCGPlayer. If it’s just individual cards I can do 100 orders picked and packed in a hour and a half. Plan is to open a TCGPlayer Direct account for bulk and the rest on eBay but I have too much bulk to sort through and not enough time until I get a card sorter.

EDIT: It’s funny the amount of people that don’t believe you, it reminds me of the Path of Exile subreddit not understanding how streamers who play the game daily are getting so much currency, it’s cause they put the time into it.

It’s not that bad if you use stock photos, there’s plenty of sites that provide appropriately sized card scans that you can just drag into your listing. I think from start to finish on a new set it takes me around 2-6 hours to list everything depending on how many cards are in the set/variants. Most of these things can be done ahead of a release too once we know all the cards in the set and you just set the quantity to 0.

I would download the CSV from tcgplayer and wrote a script that looks for it in the downloads folder, and re-prices to .01 below tcg low, with a floor. I was intentionally aggressive as I knew the prices would fall fast.

Im a Magic vendor and we sell on tcgplayer. What OP is stating is possible but also a risk. If you bought a bunch of final fantasy product before the preorder spike, you could crack and sell at max profit. We did this is almost all the Masters sets and collector booster sets. However, timing is everything. Prices tank fairly quickly and if the set is actually bad, you can get burned. We did so well with MH1 and 2 and MH3 burned us. Plus- many more people are doing exactly that and so the profitability goes down.

OP obviously did well but luck and timing plays a huge role

Good point! Of around 7000 cards I’m down to about 300 and I’m getting about 3 sales daily on those. I stopped price correcting a bit ago. Maybe 150 of those are sub .35 cards and that’s my floor.

I got more value than the 26k, I was just doing a 1 month sample window. Maybe another 5k in value and $1500 left in unsold.

First congrats and kudos to sharing as much as you have with your process. Most people wouldn't put in that work even if you spelled it out A to Z and getting cards to people who want them is a service that has substantial risk from a capital investment perspective and it is entirely appropriate to reap rewards according to that risk.

I wanted to ask you about the cheap cards you listed and specifically how they affected your strategy? Do you think they were critical in achieving your volume and/or in cross selling into the higher value cards or its just made logistical sense in your pipeline to ingest them onto tcgplayer?

I also caught onto these being profitable, but ultimately laid off as the demand seemed odd on them (summon ixon NFs were cheaper than the surges at one point), which I don't get because they are slick in person, but the aggressive pricing would helps to still make money on the way down.

also get prepared to be floored by the amount of people who browse this sub, but also don't understand you can make money cracking product at scale if you know what you're doing.

The everyone’s invited decks are the same. Buy 2 and sell one plus cards of the second you don’t need. It will pay for the cards you keep. In my case sol ring and bitter blossom Scale what I just said like OP did with FF collector decks and…. OP margins were double what this margin is currently anyways but same concept.

Hey congrats on this working out for you! Pretty sure I know what set it was and hope my semi-frequent posts about it didn't contribute to your project coming to an end! I would say that it's probably STILL a good time to buy in as the boxes are still heading down in price, but ultimately the total universe produced hasn't changed. So once the supply gets churned through the singles will likely head back up I would think... Will probably take a while at this point.

I can promise you it’s not worth it anymore lol. There’s better sealed to crack at this point.

Edit: just ran the numbers.

Tcg low is 896 Great news: price hit the bottom and floored! So that’s about 30% margin before all fees, shipping, taxes etc.

Oh no doubt, I'm just saying unless you expect these boxes to head down a significant amount at this point, if you don't mind shelling out now and waiting to sell individually in 6-12 months you could be looking at a similar scenario. I've mostly pulled my singles listings at this point (unless an individual card spikes) and am going to wait it out. Maybe add a little more product if the downward trajectory continues for a few more weeks/months.

My personal guess is that it was baldurs gate.

That set was always slept on with lots of 2-5$ uncommons. Then tarkir made all the dragon cards explode in price like tiamat or astral dragon. Somehow draft boxes were still going for 100$

Bought 3 boxes myself and made money off all 3 (roughly 20$ each)

Personally the real question is how long until sales really started, like product was purchased and ~ all arrived ready for it to be listed at the start of the 31 days. so day 1 ~1x each card listed, open product list the rest, and it took 31 days for sales assuming all revenue did not arrive until 2 weeks after day 31.

How long did it take for seller lever 4? you did your test run in that time(totally get this sentiment im still lvl3) and then what pricing strategy did you use— 5,10% above lowest market floor it with 4x copies of something playable at that level, or like 2nd,3rd lowest listing, or automatic pricing.

and This volume is wild, op ripped and shipped, hope they had fun plus the profit ofc.

maybe if I am GENEROUS with my personal timing of the 31 days when I sold some stuff from a ygo set I bought part for draft part for dice and part because I liked it, maybe if I made a crazy call this is where I would be in a couple months. (HAC1) Personally thought I bought like 2023 for draft, but sales were more end of 2023-into 2024, and some more 2025. I think it was only a 2021 2022 set.

I had tons of fun!

- Got seller level 2 on 10 June, level 3 on 21 June, level 4 on 27 June.

- I had some of the sealed product in hand when I did the initial test. I discovered this opportunity almost exactly when I hit level 4, it was a good coincidence. After seeing immediate success within 2 days I ordered more and asked for fast shipping.

- The purchase ramp up happened in increasing volume over the next 3 weeks. By then end of two weeks I had cracked over 40 sealed products.

- I knew this was temporary arbitrage and would drop extremely fast, so pricing was aggressive TCG low - .01, updated ~3x daily.

Pretend day 1 was when you noticed the sales rate and had enough sales that you were confident to buy sealed— what day was that?(maybe this gives it away since you gave us month of July)-is it june15? if so the info you needed for you to decide to do this makes it >=45 days time for that much sales. Assuming you bought sealed that day, and it took 2 weeks for sealed to arrive.

9000/45 is 200 a day (still assuming the 2 week delay on payment. you got to open 70 boxes and have personal exp pull ratios for regular, and missprint/damaged cards(and the 45 also includes payout delay on smaller/problem orders, I admit I don’t know how pirate ship tracking works but I’m assuming you did ~pwe no tracking for a lot since you said a bunch were lost, and I know pwe no tracking take longer to pay out)

Ok just looked at my sales history. First purchase for more of the product was June 21. Looks like my entire 31 day timeline was offset a bit as I was going by TCGPlayer's payment date by accident. But that volume and set of numbers is definitely in 30 days.

I was aggressive on getting the sealed to arrive. I looked for sellers in my city, arranged meetups, or asked for fast shipping.

I had zero lost pirate ship packages. All losses were < $50 pwes.

Obviously you won’t share this but I’m most curious about opportunity cost - you made money cracking sealed product and selling it via a significant arbitrage opportunity, but did the sealed product come up to meet the content price, or did the content price fall to meet the sealed price? It it’s the former, you wasted a colossal amount of time and money on selling singles instead of just sitting on the sealed for a bit and selling that. If it’s the latter, you sure got lucky to get out in time! Makes one wonder if it’s a first try beginner’s luck situation, or if you’ve spewed cash on this once or twice before and are not counting that against your profit here.

I never directly lied. Only said nope on close guesses that weren’t the exact product.

Also: my post probably harmed my profits after that. If you have tens of thousands of views, all it takes is a few dozen taking action to totally change the market.

Edit: sales on that sealed product today is already highest in over 20 days. Not all me but naive to thing posts like this don’t have influence.

At $200/product its possible it was the Phyrexian Compleate bundles? Those oil slick lands are like $7 a piece and 10 guaranteed a box. Also the oil slick mythics are quite expensive. I think the product went from $170 to $270 in the recent past so it his the price range and is now out of the price range significantly.

Didn't affect day job. It was figuring it all out as a process that was fun. $/hour was somewhere between $60-80. Didn't track it closely. If this became a serious side gig I would hire.

OP: Congratulations! I'm curious if the arbitrage is gone because the singles prices fell or because the product you were cracking went up in cost?

Sealed product is still falling in value, surprisingly. Arbitrage is always temporary and it’s exploited until there is no value left. Thats just how markets work.

What were you selling exactly? Was it final fantasy collectors? You were buying and ripping and selling singles?

how do you sell the bulk shit when everybody else is doing the same? Can you ship ten+ cards for the same customer to save on shipping?

"""

I am only interested in the reddit post and all of the comments. I eventually would like to capture and then hone-in on the info relevant to building a similar system that would allow me to take advantage of what the OP did (arbitrage, look for market gaps and openings, white space, etc.)
Here's the cleaned-up version of the Reddit post and its comments, focusing only on the relevant content:

Post Title: New TCGPlayer seller - $29k in sales in 31 days
Posted by: u/catattackskeyboard
Subreddit: r/mtgfinance
Time: 22 hours ago

Post Body:
I posted on this mid the flurry and got several dozen DMs, now that I'm through I'm posting more details if others find it helpful.

I started casually selling on TCGPlayer at the beginning of June to establish an account so I could sell my collection singles easily. I hit seller level 4 on 27 June.

Around this time I ran some numbers and noticed a set of sealed products that averaged 260% value when sold as singles. I also noticed < 10 sellers were cracking and selling this, and it was not listed on mtgstocks or mox alpha. I sold the ones I had as a test run and as it worked, I rapidly ramped up the volume.

I tracked seller volume, singles value, and sealed value daily to get an idea of when to stop buying sealed, and figured I had about 4-5 weeks before the arbitrage was gone.

My predictions were fairly accurate, and by the end of July margin was < 40% before fees so I stopped aggressively pricing and selling.

Did this for fun and to learn the seller market.

4-week stats (30 June to 30 July):

Net sales: $29,604.34

Orders: 1,827

Sealed products cracked: 70

Net per order: $16.20 (corrected from $25.50)

Net after fees: $25,808.99

Sealed cost basis: $14,100

Postage, supplies: $2,500

Profit: $9,208

Fulfillment Process:

Packing speed: ~20-30 orders/hour at peak.

Used HP LaserJet B&W printer for packing slips, thermal 4x6 label printer.

#6 envelope for <= $50 orders, 4x8 bubble mailer for >= $50 orders.

Pirateship for bubble mailer tracking, tcgtracking.com + stamps.com for #6 envelopes.

Pulling & Packing:

Used card sorting trays for rapid pulling (since it was a single set with <500 unique cards).

Materials: Top loaders, shipping shields, penny sleeves, team bags, masking tape, packing tape.

Packing slip folded around cards for security.

Errors/Learnings:

Experimented with cheap cards in folded packing slips (no toploader) but got negative feedback.

Some lost packages (~15), mis-filled orders (3), and address issues (~5).

100% positive feedback after resolving issues.

Key Takeaways:

Arbitrage opportunities exist but are short-lived (~4-5 weeks).

Automation (repricing scripts) and aggressive pricing helped maintain sales volume.

High upfront cost ($14k sealed) and labor-intensive (~2 hrs/day avg).

Top Comments & Discussion:
Guessing the Product:
Many speculated it was Final Fantasy Collector Commander Decks (FIC) due to high surge foil prices and low sealed cost at MSRP. OP neither confirmed nor denied but hinted it was a "non-booster sealed product."

Others guessed March of the Machine Aftermath Collector Boosters or Baldur's Gate, but OP dismissed these.

Automation & Tech Edge:
OP used custom scripts (self-built, as they run an automation startup) to reprice aggressively (TCG low -$0.01, updated 3x/day).

TCGPlayer is lenient on bot access; OP scraped listings every 5 mins without issues.

Labor & Profitability:
Profit after labor: ~$60-80/hr (estimated 100-150 hrs total).

Hired help at $15/hr during peak (130 orders/day).

Market Dynamics:
Opportunity faded due to:

More sellers entering the market.

TCGPlayer Direct restocking (though OP’s sales didn’t drop significantly).

OP’s advice: "Look for sets not yet on mtgstocks/mox alpha, track sealed vs. singles margins daily."

Shipping Tips:
Cheap orders (<$50): #6 envelope + tcgtracking.com (free insurance).

Bubble mailers: Pirateship for tracking.

Avoid shipping shields (caused non-machinable postage issues).

Criticism & Skepticism:
Some doubted the 260% margin, but OP provided sales proof (Imgur link).

Downvoted for not revealing the exact product, but OP argued: "People making money don’t shout opportunities publicly."

Key Insights for Building a Similar System:
Identify Arbitrage:

Track sealed vs. singles prices daily (focus on newer sets with low seller competition).

Look for gaps where major sites (mtgstocks) haven’t listed yet.

Automate Pricing:

Scripts to reprice below TCG low (OP used CSV exports + custom tools).

Frequent updates (3x/day) to stay competitive.

Efficient Fulfillment:

Invest in thermal label printers, sorting trays, and bulk supplies (toploaders, team bags).

Standardize packing to minimize errors (e.g., folded packing slips + tape).

Scale Labor:

Hire help during peaks (~$15/hr).

Focus on high-volume, low-complexity products (e.g., cracking sealed decks vs. random boosters).

Risk Management:

Expect ~5% loss (missing mail, refunds).

Exit when margins drop below 40% (OP stopped at 30%).

Final Note:
OP emphasized this was a short-term, high-effort play. For sustained success, they’re building an analytics platform to spot similar opportunities faster.

Would you like me to extract specific workflows (e.g., repricing scripts, shipping logistics) in more detail?

This response is AI-generated, for reference only.
Thank you. Yes please do extract specific workflows (e.g. repricing scripts, shipping logistics, etc.) in more detail. I am 100% invested in building a similar system that can mimic the profitibability shown here, if not even higher profitabhility. I am also interested in building a system that can be used for other cards outside of the MTG realm, and eventually, other completely different products outside of the TCG realm, if it makes sense or is a viable option.
Here’s a detailed breakdown of workflows (repricing, shipping, arbitrage hunting) and how to scale this system beyond MTG/TCG. The goal is to create a repeatable, product-agnostic arbitrage engine with minimal manual labor.

1. Arbitrage Opportunity Identification (Core System)
Objective: Find products where:

Sealed cost < Singles value (after fees/shipping).

Low competition (<10 sellers cracking it).

Temporary inefficiency (e.g., new product, mispriced, or overlooked).

Tools & Process:
Data Sources:

TCGPlayer API (or web scraping): Pull sealed/singles prices daily.

Distributor pricing (Alliance, GTS, etc.) to compare MSRP vs. market.

Mtgstocks/moxalpha alerts (for gaps: if a set isn’t listed, it’s a candidate).

eBay/Amazon (cross-check for demand spikes).

Automation:

python
# Example pseudocode to compare sealed vs. singles value
sealed_cost = get_sealed_price("FIC Collector Deck")
singles_value = sum([get_tcg_low(card) for card in FIC_cards])
margin = (singles_value * 0.85 - shipping_cost) / sealed_cost  # 15% fees approx.
if margin > 2.0:  # 200%+ margin
    send_alert("Arbitrage opportunity: FIC Collector Deck")
OP’s Edge: They ignored "obvious" sets (e.g., FF surge foils) and targeted lesser-hyped variants (e.g., Revival Trance decks).

Product-Agnostic Expansion:
Apply to Pokémon, sports cards, Lego, etc.:

Pokémon ETBs: Check TCGPlayer vs. sealed distributor costs.

Lego sets: Compare BrickLink part-out value vs. Amazon/Walmart sealed.

Key: Focus on deterministic sealed products (no randomness, like MTG precons vs. booster boxes).

2. Repricing & Inventory Management
Objective: Stay the lowest-priced seller without leaving money on the table.

OP’s Workflow:
Downloaded TCGPlayer inventory CSV daily.

Ran a script to reprice $0.01 below TCG Low, with a floor (e.g., never <$0.35).

Updated prices 3x/day (morning, noon, evening) to undercut competitors.

Automation (Scalable):
python
# Pseudocode for repricing script
import pandas as pd

inventory = pd.read_csv("tcg_inventory.csv")
for index, row in inventory.iterrows():
    tcg_low = get_tcg_low(row['card_name'])
    new_price = max(tcg_low - 0.01, 0.35)  # Floor at $0.35
    inventory.at[index, 'price'] = new_price
inventory.to_csv("reprice_tcg_upload.csv", index=False)
Tools:

TCGPlayer Seller Portal CSV Upload (no API needed).

Selenium/Puppeteer for sites without APIs (e.g., eBay, Amazon).

Product-Agnostic Expansion:
eBay/Amazon Arbitrage: Use Keepa/CamelCamelCamel to track price history, buy low/sell high.

Lego: BrickLink price guide + BrickEconomy for part-out value.

3. Shipping & Fulfillment (Scale to 100+ Orders/Day)
Objective: Minimize time per order while reducing losses.

OP’s Setup:
#6 Envelopes (PWE):

Cost: $0.63 (stamp + envelope + toploader).

Tracking: Free via tcgtracking.com (barcode scans as USPS tracking).

Bubble Mailers:

Cost: $1.50 (mailer + tracking via Pirateship).

Threshold: Use for orders >$50.

Automation:
Pirateship API: Auto-buy tracking labels for bubble mailers.

Thermal Printer (Rollo or Zebra): Auto-print labels from TCGPlayer orders.

Packing Station:

Sort cards alphabetically in trays (A-D, E-H, etc.).

Pre-fold packing slips + tape dispensers for speed.

Product-Agnostic Expansion:
Pokémon/Yugioh: Same PWE/bubble mailer process.

Small non-TCG items (e.g., collectible pins): Use #6 envelopes + stamps.com.

4. Error Reduction & Customer Service
OP’s Stats:

~15 lost packages (0.8% loss rate).

3 mis-ships (0.16% error rate).

Solutions:
Automated Tracking Uploads: Use TCGPlayer’s bulk tracking upload.

Address Validation: PirateShip’s tool checks for typos.

Refund Threshold: Auto-refund orders <$20 if lost (costs less than tracking).

5. Scaling Beyond MTG (System Design)
A. Arbitrage Hunting for Any Product:
Data Pipeline:

Scrape/sealed price → Scrape/singles price → Calculate margin → Alert.

Use Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Retailer APIs (e.g., Walmart, Target).

Example Workflow for Lego:

Input: Lego set #12345.

Step 1: Scrape Amazon sealed price ($120).

Step 2: Pull BrickLink part-out value ($200).

Step 3: Buy if margin >50% after fees/shipping.

B. Multi-Platform Selling:
List everywhere: TCGPlayer, eBay, Amazon, Facebook Marketplace.

Repricer Rules:

eBay: Match lowest "Buy It Now" price.

Amazon: Stay 1% below Buy Box.

C. Hiring Labor:
Outsource Sorting/Packing: $15/hr for local hires or VA for data entry.

Tooling: Use ShipStation to manage orders across platforms.

6. Profitability Calculator Template
Use this to evaluate any product:

plaintext
Profit = (Singles_Value * 0.85) - (Sealed_Cost + Shipping + Labor)  
Labor = (Orders_Per_Hour * Hours) * Hourly_Rate  
Example:

Crack 70 sealed products ($14k cost).

Sell 1,827 orders ($29k sales, $25k after fees).

Profit: $9k (31% ROI).

Final Advice:
Start Small: Test with 5-10 sealed units before scaling.

Focus on Deterministic Products: Avoid booster boxes (variance kills margins).

Build Your Own Data Tools: OP’s edge came from custom scripts.

Expand Gradually: Add Pokémon → Lego → general eCommerce once the system works.

Would you like me to draft a step-by-step implementation plan (e.g., Week 1: Setup scraping, Week 2: Test repricing)? Or dive deeper into a specific area (e.g., Lego arbitrage)?

This response is AI-generated, for reference only.
Yes, please draft a detailed step-by-step implementation plan. It does not need to have timestamps (i.e. week 1, week 2, etc.).
This implementation plan will be going to an LLM agent-based software development team that will develop the application (backend and frontend logic). Ultimately, they will be using this implementation plan to inform their development instructions and requirements.
Here’s a detailed, technical implementation plan for your LLM agent-based development team to build an automated arbitrage system for TCGs (and scalable to other verticals). The plan is structured as core modules, with clear inputs, processes, and outputs for each component.

Implementation Plan: Automated Arbitrage System
Objective: Build a scalable platform that:

Identifies arbitrage opportunities (sealed vs. singles).

Automates repricing/inventory management.

Streamlines order fulfillment.

Expands to other product categories (Pokémon, Lego, etc.).

Module 1: Data Acquisition & Arbitrage Detection
Inputs:

Sealed product prices (TCGPlayer, distributor APIs, eBay, Amazon).

Singles market prices (TCGPlayer, eBay, BrickLink for Lego).

Inventory lists (for sets/cards to track).

Process:

Scrape/API Integration:

TCGPlayer: Use unofficial API (web scraping via Python/Selenium) or partner API if approved.

Endpoint: https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/product?q=[SET_NAME]

eBay/Amazon: Scrape via BeautifulSoup/Scrapy or use Keepa/CamelCamelCamel APIs.

Distributors: Alliance (for MTG), Walmart API (for Lego MSRP).

Margin Calculation:

python
def calculate_margin(sealed_cost, singles_list, fee_rate=0.15):  
    singles_value = sum([card['price'] for card in singles_list])  
    return (singles_value * (1 - fee_rate)) / sealed_cost  
Alert Thresholds:

Flag products with margin > 1.8 (80% ROI before fees).

Prioritize products with <10 active sellers.

Output:

Database of arbitrage opportunities (e.g., {product: "FIC Collector Deck", margin: 2.6, sellers: 5}).

Module 2: Repricing Engine
Inputs:

Current inventory (CSV/API from TCGPlayer, eBay, etc.).

Real-time market prices (from Module 1).

Process:

Price Adjustment Rules:

For each item in inventory:

Fetch TCG Low (or equivalent).

Set price to max(TCG_Low - 0.01, price_floor).

Price floors:

MTG: $0.35

Pokémon: $0.50

Lego: $1.00

Update Frequency:

Batch updates every 4 hours (avoid rate limits).

Platform Integration:

TCGPlayer: Upload CSV via Seller Portal.

eBay/Amazon: Use their Seller APIs or Selenium automation.

Output:

Updated inventory listings across platforms.

Module 3: Order Processing & Fulfillment
Inputs:

Orders (TCGPlayer/eBay/Amazon API or CSV export).

Shipping rules (PWE vs. bubble mailer).

Process:

Order Routing:

Classify orders by:

PWE (#6 envelope): Orders <$50, 1-4 cards.

Bubble Mailer: Orders >$50 or >4 cards.

Label Generation:

PWE: Use tcgtracking.com or stamps.com for USPS barcodes.

Bubble Mailer: PirateShip API for discounted tracking.

Packing Automation:

Printer Setup: Thermal label printer (Rollo) + packing slip printer.

Packing Station UI:

Display order + card locations (e.g., "A-D Tray, Slot 2").

Auto-print shipping labels/packing slips.

Output:

Shipping labels + tracking numbers uploaded to seller portals.

Module 4: Error Handling & Customer Service
Inputs:

Lost package reports (platform APIs or email alerts).

Customer messages.

Process:

Auto-Refund Rules:

Orders <$20: Auto-refund if tracking shows no delivery after 14 days.

Orders >$20: Escalate to manual review.

Address Validation:

Integrate USPS Address Validation API for order imports.

Feedback Monitoring:

Scrape seller ratings daily, flag negatives for review.

Output:

Resolved cases + logs for continuous improvement.

Module 5: Expansion to New Verticals
Inputs:

New product categories (e.g., Pokémon, Lego, sports cards).

Process:

Data Model Adaptation:

Pokémon: Map ETB (sealed) to TCGPlayer singles prices.

Lego: Use BrickLink API for part-out values.

Rule Adjustments:

Shipping: Lego sets may require boxes vs. bubble mailers.

Price Floors: Adjust for category (e.g., $1.00 for Lego parts).

Output:

New arbitrage streams with category-specific rules.

Technical Requirements for Dev Team
Backend:

Language: Python (Scrapy, Selenium, Pandas).

Databases: PostgreSQL (for arbitrage logs), Redis (real-time price cache).

APIs: TCGPlayer (unofficial), PirateShip, eBay, Amazon MWS.

Frontend:

Dashboard: React/Next.js for monitoring margins/orders.

Packing Station: Touchscreen UI with order prioritization.

Infrastructure:

Hosting: AWS EC2 (for scrapers) + Lambda (for repricing).

Scheduler: Apache Airflow for batch jobs.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Arbitrage Detection:

Time-to-identify new opportunities (<1 hour from price change).

Order Fulfillment:

Packing speed (>20 orders/hour).

Error rate (<0.5%).

Profitability:

ROI per product (>25% net margin).

Example Workflow (End-to-End)
Arbitrage Detection:

System detects "FIC Collector Deck" has 260% margin.

Inventory Purchase:

Buys 70 decks at $201/unit from distributor.

Repricing:

List singles at $0.01 below TCG Low, update 3x/day.

Fulfillment:

1,827 orders processed in 30 days (60 orders/hour peak).

Profit:

$9,208 net profit after fees/shipping.

Next Steps for Dev Team:
Prioritize Module 1 (Data Acquisition) first to validate arbitrage logic.

Build repricing engine (Module 2) with TCGPlayer CSV as MVP.

Use PirateShip API (Module 3) for shipping automation.

Let me know if you’d like to drill deeper into any module (e.g., Lego-specific scrapers) or need pseudocode for specific components!
